 The aim of this group/repository is to centralize resources in Math, Computer Sciecne and Design. To do so, it builds off existing resources. Sometimes, such a meta resource already exists, in which case the website simply embeds it. Together, all the web pages in turn coalesce to form a meta-resource of meta-resources.
