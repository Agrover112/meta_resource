# meta_resources

-----------------------------------------

## What is it

meta_resources is an initiative by M68 to collect, oragnise and store the world's largest decentralised collection of open data and to make it accessible to everyone. It was born out of the belief that the internet is full of useful resources that remain hidden from the people who can benefit from them. By building and maintaining an organised database of such resouces, we can help each other learn and work, smarter. 

## Our Moto

Resources, by the people, of the people, for the people.

## How it Works 

We maintain a well organised [airtable](https://airtable.com/) database of the resources, accessible by anyone with a will to learn!

You can check the main database and search, sort or filter resources and find the best ones for your needs or just browse through the database, trying to find inspiration in the resources.

Each resource is formated as a tuple of **(description, link, type, contributor)**where,
- **Description** is a short description of what the resource is about.
- **link** is the hyperlink to the resource, or a download link.
- **type** is the type of the resource, which can be one of the following:
 - Project or Tools
 - Learning Resource(courses, books, references etc.)
 - People/Labs/Organisations
 - Opportunities/Jobs
 - Conferences/Workshops/Talks
- **contributor** is the name of the person who contributed the resource.

## How to Contribute

- Open [the submission form.](https://airtable.com/shrJ7bvP1gnZAGLZn) 
- Add to the fields described above.
- Click submit to add the resource to the database.

## Code of Conduct

### **Introduction**

The Code of Conduct is meant to ensure a seamless collaboration between the members of the community and to drive our primary goals. We created it not because we anticipate bad behavior, but because we believe that articulating our values and obligations to one another reinforces the already exceptional level of respect among the members of the community and because having a code provides us with clear avenues to correct our culture should it ever stray from that course. This Code of Conduct applies to community members and M68 team members in all the communities online (including but not limited to IRC, support chat, the M68 Slack group, Twitter, and WhatsApp).

### Some of the regulations to keep in mind are:
- The resources contributed **must** not be illegal or pirated in any way, shape or form.
- The community should be open to and supportive of each other.
- The discussions in the aforementioned online communities must be polite, formal and in alignment with the goals of the community.
- Spamming the database with illegal or unacceptable resources will lead to ban from the community.
- The project maintainers will have sole discretion in case of any disputes arising out of the use of the resources or contributions.
- Adhere to the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/M-68/meta_resource/blob/deploy/CONTRIBUTING.md)(in the works) to ensure the best experience for everyone.

### Apart from this, a few basic rules for contributors are:

1. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the Git history in any way.
1. **Non-master branches** ought to be used for ongoing work.
1. **External API changes and significant modifications** ought to be subject to an **internal pull-request** to solicit feedback from other contributors.
1. Internal pull-requests to solicit feedback are *encouraged* for any other non-trivial contribution but left to the discretion of the contributor.
1. Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing code-style.
